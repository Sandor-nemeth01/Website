<h2>Adobe Creative Suite</h2>
<p>Adobe offers the most popular and well designed photo editing tool out there, photoshop. Although it really isn't actually that much to write home about, it and it's fellow Adobe software companions remain the most popular tools for their jobs around.</p>

<h3>Photoshop</h3>

</a>
<p>Photoshop is an image manipulation program with a fully fledged set of tools, ranging from blurring, cutting, and layers, to colors for image drawing too. In my personal experience, it does everything better than the free alternative Gimp does. The example photoshop file shows a simple impact font with a black outline, like the old memes.</p>

<h3>Illustrator</h3>

<p>Illustrator is a vector art design program. Vector art is created using math and basic geometry to create clean art that can be scaled up or down infinitely.</p>

<p>Dreamweaver is a web development program which features a split view between a live look at your website and the code behind it. The example file is simply a javascript "hello world" file that prints it out to the console.</p>
