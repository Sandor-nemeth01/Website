<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>A decent chunk of IT related stuff is also programming. Until this year, programming has been an independent project, although this year was web based development.</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

</a>
<p>HTML stands for hyper text markup language, and forms the core of every website. It defines where things will go, if they're a header or paragraph, and so on. The included download file is a copy of my index file which shows off a bit of basic html and iframe work.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

</a>
<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheet and is generally what makes websites look good, unlike mine. It can do simple things such as set colors of things like text, define positions of elements, and much much more. The example file includes two simple effects to change the largest header to a deep blue and the body tag to a light blue.</p>
<br>
<h3>Javascript</h3>

</a>
<p>Javascript is the programming language of choice for web development. It compiles on runtime, so there's no need to make a program for each platform. Javascript generally handles things such as clicks or the alert boxes that appear. It more often does background stuff that visual however. The example javascript file contains an onclick element and a console.log element.</p>
