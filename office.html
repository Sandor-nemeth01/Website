<h2>Office</h2>
<p>A decent chunk of our efforts also focused on getting certifications for Microsoft Office. Along with those, we also learned about how to use the whole suite of office programs, and below are all of the programs, as well as example files.</p>
<p>All files can be downloaded by clicking on the pictures.</p>
